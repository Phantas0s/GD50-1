# CS50 Introduction to computer science

I made this repository to showcase my solutions to [CS50’s
Introduction to Game Development](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/) problem sets. This course is Harvard University's introduction to interactive game design and development which I am fallowing during 2021. It is composed of 10 lectures in which great classic video games such as Super Mario Bros., Zelda and Pokémon are used to explain game design concepts and how these games are actually implemented. The course starts exploring 2D games using the scripting language [Lua](https://www.lua.org) and [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) as a framework, fallowing up with the introduction of a 3D game engine [Unity](https://unity.com) and C# to program more advanced 3D games such as Portal. The course ends with a final project in which students are asked to program their very first game using either of the introduced frameworks and the associated programming language. I am still working on my final project and I will update this repository as soon as it is ready.

## Disclaimer

Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [Academic Honesty](https://docs.cs50.net/2016/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty) policy of the course.
